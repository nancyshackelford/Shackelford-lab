",2005,Ongoing,Central Westcoast Forest Society,,,"Most of the logging in the Kennedy Flats area occurred during the 1950’s and 1960’s, with some additional logging in the 1970’s and 1980’s. ","Decaying logging roads with collapsed culverts and bridges, coupled with cross spanning logging debris and residual shake spall from the salvage loggers has resulted in severely degraded
fish habitat. Vast areas of the Kennedy Flats streams are literally plugged with woody debris affecting fish passage (creating barriers in many cases), water quality, and hydrology.
The high concentration of woody debris areas act as semi-permeable dams, flooding large tracts of forest land. The water quality is especially poor during the summer months as the flood plain creates increased surface area for solar radiation, resulting in increased water temperature to near critical levels and lowers dissolved oxygen content. The flood plains create a poor growing site for conifer tree species, resulting in poor cover and further exacerbating the water quality problem. Slower water flow has failed to keep spawning beds clean of settled organics, making quality spawning sites the most limiting factor for fish production. Ironically, the clustered woody debris segments of the Kennedy Flats streams have resulted in the interception of natural Large Woody Debris (LWD) recruitment, causing many segments of creeks between the debris clusters to be
LWD deficient, resulting in lengthy sections of stream without needed
complexing.", Coastal Western Hemlock biogeoclimatic (BEC) zone,"Kennedy Flats includes the traditional territory of the Tla-o-qui-aht, and Ucluelet First Nations.

Despite the loss of riparian vegetation in Meadow and lower Kilpala the reduced bank strength does not seem to have contributed to channel widening. This is likely due to the incised and confined nature of these stream channels. However, the loss of riparian trees has effected the recruitment of LWD and shading of the affected reaches.
The logging of steep slopes and road building have increased this natural landslide rate as well as destabilizing the steep gullies leading to torrents. Tributaries have been impacted by landslides directly entering the stream channel, whose coarse sediment remains

pool, and the ‘cut’ ends could be anchored to the bank. Anchoring was
accomplished by epoxying each log to a bedrock outcrop along this bank, and by cabling anchor rocks to the instream end and the nearshore end of each piece.
• In Reach 3, immediately downstream from the confluence of the Sarita
and the South Sarita Rivers, 12 large logs some with roots attached, were cabled in a criss-cross fashion, to each other and to two large rootwads, to create a large crib. This was anchored to the streambank and extended into a large pool, with additional anchoring provided by ballast rocks.
• A modified crib was constructed in Reach 3 of the Sarita River, immediately
downstream from the Blenheim mainline bridge. Four large logs with roots,
and two logs without roots, were arranged and cabled into a loose crib structure to provide stability during high flows. The rooted ends were extended into the adjacent pool, where they could promote scour. The structure was anchored by cabling the logs to large ballast rocks on both
the streambank and instream ends.
