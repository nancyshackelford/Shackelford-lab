","Decaying logging roads with collapsed culverts and bridges, coupled with cross spanning logging debris and residual shake spall from the salvage loggers has resulted in severely degraded fish habitat. Vast areas of the Kennedy Flats streams are literally plugged with woody debris affecting fish passage (creating barriers in many cases), water quality, and hydrology. The high concentration of woody debris areas act as semi-permeable dams, flooding large tracts of forest land. The water quality is especially poor during the summer months as the floodplain creates increased surface area for solar radiation, resulting in increased water temperature to near critical levels and lowers dissolved oxygen content. The floodplains create a poor growing site for conifer tree species, resulting in poor cover and further exacerbating the water quality problem. Slower water flow has failed to keep spawning beds clean of settled organics, making quality spawning sites the most limiting factor for fish production. Ironically, the clustered woody debris segments of the Kennedy Flats streams have resulted in the interception of natural Large Woody Debris (LWD) recruitment, causing many segments of creeks between the debris clusters to be

Gravel bar stability has been impacted by heavy use of recreational vehicles utilizing these areas for campgrounds. The impacts to gravel bars have been impeded natural revegetation of bars, and discharge of gray water into the Taylor River and removal of LWD for firewood.",Coastal Western Hemlock biogeoclimatic (BEC) zone,,"Coho Salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), Sockeye Salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), Steelhead Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), and Cutthroat Trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii clarkii)","The primary objective of the project is to develop an existing borrow pit to increase the productive capacity of this off-channel habitat. In its present state the borrow pit has a good groundwater supply, but lacks depth and complexity for rearing habitat","• The areas that were disturbed (the shoreline, both islands and the peninsula) were revegetated with cottonwood whips (Populus balsamifera spp. trichocarpa), willow whips (Salix spp.), hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), spruce (Picea sitchensis) and western red cedar (Thuja plicata) seedlings and seeded with West Coast Hemlock Mix and Fall Rye.
• Vegetation of the islands was set up to eventually provide shade to the middle area of the pond.","• The bed elevation was lowered by an average of 1.5m (range: <0.5 to max 2.0 m). During excavation 2 small islands and a peninsula were created with some of the excavated materials. 
• The islands and peninsula increase the shore line margins which will provide extensive shallow areas where food production is high. The deep areas of the pond will provide refuge from predators.
• The pond was complexed with LWD and large boulders to provide further cover for juvenile salmonids.",Enhancement of “Borrow Pit #2” will provide 0.24 ha of rearing habitat. Surveys prior to construction identified that there is low risk to this channel from mainstem flooding and shifting.,,"This project will provide 0.2 ha of rearing habitat.  Based on bio standards set out in Circular No. 9, the estimated capacity of the pond with a density of 1.01 coho fry per m2 will be 2424 coho fry.  With a survival rate of 0.68 a total of 1648 coho
smolts will be produced.",,"The following activities are proposed for the borrow pit during the 1999/00 fiscal year:
• Monitor the physical and biological results of construction works. This will include conducting inspections of structural stability of the islands and complexing materials, surveying juvenile coho and cutthroat trout abundance.
• Develop prescriptions during the winter of 1999 for the upper and lower Taylor River.
• Evaluate the success of the planting and seeding during the fall of 1998. Plant and seed where it is necessary in the spring of 1999."
